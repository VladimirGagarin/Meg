  00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:10,259
  Out on the porch where the dawn light
  glows.
  
  2
  00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,639
  A breeze brings songs that my spirit
  knows.
  
  3
  00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:21,739
  You perch unseen in the olive tree. But
  
  4
  00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,780
  your voice flies wild and sings to me.
  
  5
  00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,860
  I close my eyes, the world turns still.
  
  6
  00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,600
  You sing her songs, my heart you fill.
  
  7
  00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:42,319
  Singing bird, carry me home. Every
  
  8
  00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:47,059
  morning don't sing alone. Every melody a
  thread
  
  9
  00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,659
  of grace. Sing Magdalene's songs through
  
  10
  00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,579
  time and space. Tomorrow don't forget my
  
  11
  00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,539
  song. The Magdalene one I've loved so
  long.
  
  12
  00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,139
  Through fields of silence and restless
  skies.
  
  13
  00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,639
  Your voice still lifts when my courage
  dies.
  
  14
  00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,919
  You echo love that I once knew.
  
  15
  00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,000
  Each note a prayer that pulls me through.
  
  16
  00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:31,839
  And when I'm lost or feeling small.
  
  17
  00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,259
  Your hymns of Magdalene recall.
  
  18
  00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,339
  Singing bird, carry me home. Every
  
  19
  00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:47,059
  morning don't sing alone. Every melody a
  thread
  
  20
  00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,659

  21
  00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:56,639
  time and space. Tomorrow don't forget my
  
  22
  00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:01,119
  song. The Magdalene one I've loved so
  
  23
  00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,739
  long. You are no
  
  24
  00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,339
  ordinary bird, I know. You
  
  25
  00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,240
  carry her voice wherever you go.
  
  26
  00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,220
  So sing through the stars, sing over the
  
  27
  00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:25,159
  sea. Bring Magdalene's heart back to me.
  
  28
  00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,479
  Singing bird, carry me home.
  
  29
  00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,219
  At sunrise and twilight's golden dome.
  
  30
  00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,600
  Every melody a thread of grace.
  
  31
  00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,519
  Sing Magdalene's songs that whisper
  
  32
  00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,899
  peace. Tomorrow don't forget my song. The
  
  33
  00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,739
  Magdalene one, still singing strong.
  
  34
  00:02:57,179 --> 00:03:02,179
  Yes, singing bird, don't ever go. You sing
  what only
  
  35
  00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,199
  heaven knows, the Magdalene
  
  36
